Masterplan is a rails web application created by Naveen Pai for his senior CS Capstone project at Palo Alto High School. The app prototype can be found at https://thawing-oasis-25877.herokuapp.com/.

Currently, the app's functionality includes:

* User signup and secure login
* Session managment
* Photo upload

How it works:

The application models, which contain business logic and object relationships, can be found in app/models. Similarly, the application controllers, which manage how the user interacts with the data, can be found in app/controllers. The application views, embedded markup, are arranged by their corresponding controller in app/views.
